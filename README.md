After the latest update, the quest progression was reset. For those like me who don't want to redo a million quests, here's a short guide:

1. **Enable Creative Menu**
   - Type `cm` in the console.

2. **Enable Developer Blocks**
   
3. **Search for "t6quest"**

4. **Use and Complete It Several Times**
   - Repeat until you reach the desired result.
   - The rewards from the quest, including experience points, have been removed. This will help quickly restore quest progression without gaining unnecessary experience and rewards.

**Don't forget to disable the daily quest limit in the settings.**
